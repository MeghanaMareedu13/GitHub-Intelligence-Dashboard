🚀 Day 13 of my #30DaysOfCode Challenge: The GitHub Intelligence Dashboard!

APIs are the glue of the modern internet, but building a "Basic API Script" isn't the same as building a "Resilient API System."

Today, I built a tool that deep-dives into GitHub profile data, but the real magic is "under the hood." ⚙️

Building this project allowed me to showcase:
✅ Resilient Networking: Implementing Exponential Backoff to handle API rate limits gracefully.
✅ Data Engineering: Normalizing complex, nested JSON into analytical DataFrames.
✅ Health Scoring: Designing a custom model to evaluate repository maturity and maintenance.

Whether it's integrating a Fintech API or a Healthcare data stream, the principles are the same: respecting the provider, handling errors, and extracting value.
